##Date 15th April

#Folders nicely done - but first page html file should be named
#Assignment not complete it should have two pages
#960 is loaded first and reset later - this would negate the css of 960 - please check - you may have written your own css to compensate for that which is unnecessary
#Comments in HTMl - quite good however could not find the same in the CSS File
#Code indented in HTML - but was not done in the case of CSS
#Page has come out well - can be more neater towards the end (Footer etc.)
